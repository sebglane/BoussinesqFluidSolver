Error! This tutorial requires a deal.II library that was configured with the following options:
    DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC = ON
    DEAL_II_PETSC_WITH_COMPLEX = OFF
    DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST = ON
or
    DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS = ON
    DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST = ON
However, the deal.II library found at ${DEAL_II_PATH} was configured with these options
    DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC = ${DEAL_II_WITH_PETSC}
    DEAL_II_PETSC_WITH_COMPLEX = ${DEAL_II_PETSC_WITH_COMPLEX}
    DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST = ${DEAL_II_WITH_P4EST}
    DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS = ${DEAL_II_WITH_TRILINOS}
which conflict with the requirements.
One or both of the aforementioned combinations of prerequisites are not met by your installation, but at least one is required for this tutorial step."
